## Technologies Used
This project is developed by,

**Note:** The main database system is Postgres. If you want to clone and use the project, then after cloning you have to create config.py and setting your MONGODB_SETTINGS and SECRET_KEY within your Config class. Otherwise this application will not work properly.
